# Introduction
The aim of this project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the Uber Drives - 2016 dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. I used Python and various data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean and analyze the data.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

# Dataset
The Uber Drives - 2016 dataset contains data on Uber rides from January to June 2016. The dataset contains the following columns:

Trip ID: A unique identifier for each trip

Start Date: The date and time when the trip started

End Date: The date and time when the trip ended

Start Location: The starting location of the trip (latitude and longitude)

End Location: The ending location of the trip (latitude and longitude)

Purpose of the trip: The purpose of the trip, such as business or personal

# Methodology
The methodology followed in this project was as follows:

Data cleaning: I used pandas to clean the dataset, which involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

Data visualization: I used matplotlib and seaborn to create various visualizations, such as time series plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to explore the data and identify patterns and relationships.

Data analysis: I used pandas and numpy to perform data analysis on the cleaned dataset. I calculated various statistics such as the average duration of trips and the most common purpose of trips.

# Results
The results of this analysis showed that:

The most common purpose of trips was business.

The number of trips increased during weekdays compared to weekends.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into the Uber Drives - 2016 dataset, which can be useful for further analysis and decision-making. The use of Python and various data analysis libraries made the analysis efficient and effective.
